# Figtreejs
Figtreejs aims to bring phylogenetic visualization to the browser. 
The goal is to support small and large applications alike and make the power and fun of playing with tree visualizations accessible to researchers with little to no experience in web design.

This repo is based on [https://github.com/rambaut/figtree.js/](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree.js/) and lessons learned from [https://github.com/jtmccr1/figtreejs-react](https://github.com/jtmccr1/figtreejs-react). But most of all it is inspired by the original [figtree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree).
